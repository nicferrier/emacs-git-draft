;;; Commentary:

;; This let's you make a draft of what has changed in your git project
;; for inserting into commit messages.  In your commit buffer do:

;;   M-x git-draft

;; and git-draft will analyze your changes and try and pull out
;; function names that have changed.

;; It probably only works for EmacsLisp and similar languages.  And
;; it's just not very good anyway.  But it's a start.  Maybe.

;; == Obvious todos

;; We clearly need to be able to install into a hook for git commit,
;; either magit's or vc's.  I guess that should be configurable or
;; something.
